Have you ever been indecisive when picking food well here you go, you can have this script easily tell you.
Type `python P1` into the command line and BOOM, you have a food place.
You can also add a chain by simply typeing `python P1 add` and it allows you to add any restraunt you want. 
Go on, give it a try!



# Project 2 - Zach
- Expanding upon server stats, implemented SMTP scripting to allow server-stat receipts emailed directly to those interested!
To run the script put `node P2`exactly how it is
go to `http://localhost:3000/`
click `Get Info About This System` this will take you to the system info 
then input your email
then you will receive an email, make sure to check your spam folder as well.
Enjoy!
