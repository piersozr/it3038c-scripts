# Project 2 - Zach
- Expanding upon server stats, implemented SMTP scripting to allow server-stat receipts emailed directly to those interested!
To run the script put `node P2`exactly how it is
go to `http://localhost:3000/`
click `Get Info About This System` this will take you to the system info 
then input your email
then you will receive an email, make sure to check your spam folder as well.
Enjoy!
